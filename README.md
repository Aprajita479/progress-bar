# Readme

This repository contains code for a Python script that demonstrates the usage of the `time` module and the `tqdm` library for tracking progress.

## Installation

To run this code, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Additionally, you need to install the `tqdm` library. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install tqdm
```

## Usage

You can run the script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
python script.py
```

The script demonstrates two different methods of tracking progress:

1. Using the `time` module:
   - The script imports the `time` module.
   - It contains a loop that iterates 10 times.
   - For each iteration, it calls the `time.sleep()` function with an argument of 2, which pauses the execution for 2 seconds.

2. Using the `tqdm` library:
   - The script imports the `tqdm` library.
   - It imports the `time` module again.
   - It contains a loop that uses the `tqdm()` function to create a progress bar.
   - The loop iterates 10 times.
   - For each iteration, it calls the `time.sleep()` function with an argument of 2, which pauses the execution for 2 seconds.

The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to use the `time` module for delays and the `tqdm` library for progress tracking.
